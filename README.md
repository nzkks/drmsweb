I have used following web technologies to create this website.

|   |   |   |   |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| HTML5 | CSS3 | JQuery | Pug |
| Sass | Susy Grid | Breakpoint-Sass | Fancybox |
| Slick Slider | Font-Awesome | Node | Express |
| Bower | Gulp | Webpack | Github / Bitbucket |

_Still this website is in 'Beta' stage. I feel many things could be improved. Lot of checks needed._

#### TODO: (to myself)
- Still there are two _Content Security Policy_ issues shows in Chrome browser. _style-src - jQuery_
- Remove mousehover effects in mobile phone or small screen.
- Add Captcha control in the Contact form.
- Try to come out of the dilemma to add section title for the skillset and the testimonials.
